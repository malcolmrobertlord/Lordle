Welcome to Lordle! 

Inspired by Wordle, the internet game where you guess a 5 letter word  in 6 attempts and the game gives  feedback and your current guesses.

This is a React project that uses a node package to grab a random word each time you load the page. It then uses an API to validate your guesses to make sure they are real words.

I also added in some stylings and animations to make it look very similar to the actual Wordle.
